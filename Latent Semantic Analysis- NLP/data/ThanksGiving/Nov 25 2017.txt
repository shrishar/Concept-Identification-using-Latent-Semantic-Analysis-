People celebrate Thanksgiving without knowing the real facts. Why should we celebrate the day pilgrims were sick and begging for food? Why was the Indian land taken afterwards?

My family always has Mac & Cheese on Thanksgiving .
"Really, thank you -- it was great to hear my mom stress about about the tax write-offs you are eliminating on Thanksgiving . But if it means your kids don't have to pay taxes, it's all worth it."
The best Thanksgiving decision @GillianIsGreat and I made for the meal was saying no to the turkey and saying yes to porchetta. The only regret I have was that we should've bought more porchetta. And for being a negative nancy about mashed potato waffles. Those were amazing.
Done with Thanksgiving food at this point
