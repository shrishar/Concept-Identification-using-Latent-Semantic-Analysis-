What a wonderful Thanksgiving break. Glad to see family and many friends. Feeling good about starting the work week now.

I was raised by my Ghanaian mother....so I could care less about Thanksgiving (more like ThanksTaking)....but I do love food. Being a resident physician resulted in me working and resorting to taco bell on Thursday. I don't even like taco hell.
I'm in Canada so we had our Thanksgiving last month. Did you have a good one?
Happy Thanksgiving to you too!
