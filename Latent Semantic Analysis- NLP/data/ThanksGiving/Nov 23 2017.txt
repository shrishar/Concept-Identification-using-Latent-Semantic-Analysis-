Watching the Cowboys play like garbage is an underrated Thanksgiving pleasure. It's been a while.
Nothing says Thanksgiving in Trump-sylvia like taking away health insurance from millions of people and raising the taxes of millions more.
No one really likes turkey dinner. Thanksgiving is just something that is so engrained in American culture that you all have tricked yourself into thinking you like it.
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!
Happy Thanksgiving to you President Trump. Thank You for Making America Great Again!
And what a happy Thanksgiving it is! Touchdown LA!
