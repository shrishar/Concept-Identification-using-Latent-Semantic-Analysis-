"Thanksgiving and other holidays are weird for me anyway. Closest family is 700+ miles away, and no local friends to spend them with either. My remaining brother and I don't really talk. There's no hate or anything, we just haven't had anything to say to each other in years."

"To keep them separate from the world and therefore in the JW bubble. Keep them separate in every way . Though I knew many JWs that had a turkey and traditional dinner on Thanksgiving but would say, ""it's just dinner and turkeys are on sale""."
