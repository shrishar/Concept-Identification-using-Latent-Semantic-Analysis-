Everyone needs to remember the name Haley Geftman - Gold the reprehensible woman from CBS who commented no sympathy was deserved for victims in Vegas because they might be Republicans who liked country western music. Watch out because I think she's a sociopath.
You've gone 12 years without breaking a mug? I'm lucky if I make it 12 months. (Joking aside--the Vegas massacre is utterly horrific.)
There is a vigil tonight at the SLS on the corner of Sahara and Las Vegas Blvd at 6pm if anybody wants to come out and pay their respects.
